            <p>
                Hello! I'm a developer with a passion for cybersecurity, backend systems, and creating tools
                that solve real-world problems. I enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies and applying them
                to build efficient and robust applications. My experience includes building projects like the 
                ones you see below.

                <h3>Card Inventory Manager</h3>
                <p>
                    A fairly simple yet effective inventory manager I made specifically for Pokemon card inventory management for card vendors. It features a rugged barebones UI, but does exactly what it was made for. It allows the user 
                    to create entries of trading cards (name, number, condition, buy price) and creates a database entry for them, which is then displayed in an Excel-like fashion. It also automatically generates a 12-digit barcode with
                    accompanying png for labeling purposes. Each entry can also be "Sold" in which after entering a sold amount and submitting, moves that entry into the "Sold Card" database. Although this project has little to do with
                    my area of expertise, It was very enjoyable and offered a good perspective into frontend and user-friendly development.
